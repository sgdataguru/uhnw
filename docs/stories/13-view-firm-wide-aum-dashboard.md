# User Story: 13 - View Firm-Wide AUM Dashboard

**As a** Managing Partner,
**I want** to view firm-wide AUM (Assets Under Management), growth rates, and attrition metrics,
**so that** I can monitor overall business health and identify areas requiring attention.

## Acceptance Criteria

* Dashboard displays total firm-wide AUM with visual trend indicator
* Growth rates shown for configurable time periods (MTD, QTD, YTD)
* Client attrition metrics displayed with trend analysis
* Key numbers are prominently displayed as headline metrics
* Dashboard provides less-cluttered, executive-level overview
* Clicking on metrics drills down to detailed RM-level view
* Supports 100CR+ client segment focus (TAM of ~4,400 individuals)

## Notes

* Meeting discussion: "First page shows key numbers... click to second page for detailed list"
* "Managing partner would want to see all that information"
* Page 1 highlights include: Firm-wide AUM, growth rates & attrition
* First page should be "less cluttered" for managing partners
* Total of 30-35 RMs in the organization
