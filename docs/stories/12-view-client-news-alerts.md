# User Story: 12 - View Client-Specific News Alerts

**As a** Relationship Manager,
**I want** to see news alerts filtered specifically for my prospects and target clients,
**so that** I stay informed about relevant developments without manually monitoring news channels.

## Acceptance Criteria

* News feed displays articles/alerts relevant to tracked prospects
* News is filtered based on the TAM (Total Addressable Market) client list
* Each news item shows: headline, source, date, and linked prospect(s)
* News alerts are updated in near real-time
* RM can click through to read full article
* News is client-specific, not generic market news
* Supports alerts for 100CR+ UHNW individuals in the target list

## Notes

* Meeting discussion: "RMs refer to news channels to find out if clients are in the news"
* "Filter news based on top thousand people in the lead"
* "TAM-linked news feed (client-specific, not generic)"
* APIs can capture client names appearing in media sources
* Replaces manual process of setting up alerts and watching news
