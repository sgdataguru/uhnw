# User Story: 1 - View Early Liquidity Signals

**As a** Relationship Manager handling UHNW clients,
**I want** to view early liquidity signals detected from multiple data sources,
**so that** I can gain a first-mover advantage and engage with clients before opportunities become obvious in the market.

## Acceptance Criteria

* Dashboard displays a list of detected liquidity signals with timestamps
* Each signal shows the source (margin changes, corporate actions, acquisitions, early exit indicators)
* Signals are sorted by recency and relevance
* Signal details include the affected client/prospect and signal type
* Signals are updated in near real-time as new data is ingested
* Signals categorized by timeline: 30-day, 60-day, 90-day triggers
* Filter by signal urgency/timeline window
* Focus on 100CR+ UHNW individuals (TAM of ~4,400 people)

## Notes

* Liquidity signals can come from multiple systems: margin-related changes, corporate actions, acquisitions, or early exit indicators
* The key value is timing - detecting changes early provides competitive advantage
* Data sources include PrivateCircle, Zauba, IPO-related data, exchange and market intelligence sources
* Page 1 highlights: "Liquidity event signals (30-90 day triggers)"
* Meeting discussion: "If some liquidity event is happening we are not reaching there on time"
