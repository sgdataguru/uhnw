# User Story: 11 - Add Liquidity Events Manually

**As a** Relationship Manager,
**I want** to manually add liquidity events that I discover through my own channels,
**so that** the system captures intelligence that may not be available from automated data sources.

## Acceptance Criteria

* RM can access an "Add Liquidity Event" form from the interface
* Form allows entry of: client/prospect name, event type, expected timeline, source of information
* Added events appear in the system alongside auto-detected signals
* Manually added events are clearly marked as RM-contributed
* Events can be edited or removed by the RM who added them
* Added events trigger lead scoring updates for affected prospects

## Notes

* Discussed in meeting: "Can RM add liquidity events? Yes, we can have that feature"
* RMs have knowledge from their relationships that automated systems may miss
* This creates a two-way system where RMs both consume and contribute intelligence
