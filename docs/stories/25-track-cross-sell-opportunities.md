# User Story: 25 - Track Cross-Sell Opportunities

**As a** Relationship Manager,
**I want** to see cross-sell opportunities for my clients,
**so that** I can expand product adoption and deepen client relationships.

## Acceptance Criteria

* Dashboard identifies clients with cross-sell potential
* Shows which products/services client doesn't currently use
* AI-driven recommendations based on client profile and similar clients
* Opportunity scoring to prioritize outreach
* Links cross-sell to liquidity events (e.g., new funds = investment opportunity)
* Tracks conversion of cross-sell recommendations
* Integration with wallet share analysis

## Notes

* Additional elements: "Cross-sell opportunity tracker"
* Helps RMs expand share of wallet with existing clients
* Should be data-driven, not generic product pushing
